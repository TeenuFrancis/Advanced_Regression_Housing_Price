## General Information
To build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion:The optimal value of alpha for Ridge Regression is 1 and for Lasso Regression is 0.001. 
The R-squared and the RMSE values of the Lasso Regression turned out to be better than the Ridge Regression.
The initial five most important predictor variables for the optimum value of alpha =0.001 are 'GrLivArea','TotalBsmtSF','OverallQual_9','LotArea','BsmtFinSF1'.
Solutions of the subjective questions are also added in the same python file.
